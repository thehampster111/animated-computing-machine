<h1>Kirkcudbright blog</h1>
<p>Today we went a walk around the town and then went to some shops.</p><br>
<p>First we went a walk down a path to get to town. When we got there we first walked around to look around the town and saw the castle. We could not go in because it was a potential danger. After that we went to the art galleries and got a postcard for mum and dad. Don't word they wont find out anytime soon because they don't read my blogs.</p>
